# 3. CSS Color Markers



## Introduction

"CSS Color Makers" is created using HTML and CSS. Markers are made to look 3D by using CSS features such as linear-gradient, box-shadow, and different color expressions.

This project uses following types of color values:

- RGB and RGBA colors (Red, Green, Blue, Angle)

  ```
  rgba(255, 255, 255) /* white */
  rgba(255, 255, 255, .5) /* white with 50% opacity */
  rgba(255 255 255 / 0.5); /* CSS Colors 4 space-separated values */
  ```

- Hexadecimal colors (#RRGGBBAA)

  ```
  #RGB        // The three-value syntax
  #RGBA       // The four-value syntax
  #RRGGBB     // The six-value syntax
  #RRGGBBAA   // The eight-value syntax
  ```

- HSL & HSLA colors (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Angle)

  ```
  hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 1) /* #5f0 */
  hsla(235, 100%, 50%, .5) /* #0015ff with 50% opacity */
  hsla(235 100% 50% / 1); /* CSS Colors 4 space-separated 
  ```
